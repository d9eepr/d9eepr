## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Deepraj here.

As a Graduate Intern at Dell Technologies, my journey is characterized by the innovation of PTIE, an automation framework enhancing product code regression detection. In this venture, React JS and GraphQL played pivotal roles in crafting a user-friendly dashboard and efficient APIs, while Grafana facilitated insightful performance analysis. My education in Artificial Intelligence at Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology underpins these endeavors, equipping me with the expertise to navigate complex technological landscapes.

Previously, as a Cloud & Infra Engineer at LTI - Larsen & Toubro Infotech, I excelled in middleware management and security enhancement, leveraging my skills in Java and Oracle SOA. The transformation I contributed to spanned from development to production, ensuring robust security measures. My technical acumen, coupled with a collaborative spirit, drives me to create solutions that not only meet but exceed the strategic goals of my team and organization.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know that there are more possible chess games than there are atoms in the observable universe?

The estimated number of atoms in the observable universe is around 10^80, while the number of possible unique chess games is 10^120. This means there are more possible chess games than atoms by a factor of 10^40!
